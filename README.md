### What does Two Nouns do?
Through Two Nouns users can create their own magazines with content from across the web. To get started, copy and the URL for an article that you want to read. From your Two Nouns dashboard you can input that URL. We will extract the content from the link and start compiling your magazine. Add as many articles as you would like to make your magazine. Once you have added all of the articles you want, name and publish your magazine. Once published, your magazines can downloaded or emailed.

In summary, Two Nouns creates distraction free, personally curated journalism.
